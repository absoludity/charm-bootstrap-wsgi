The wsgi-app charm role
=======================

This ansible role can be included in your charm, enabling you to re-use
existing tested charm functionality to deploy your wsgi application.

To see an example of how this role can be used for a charm, see XXX.

The role assumes that your charm defines the following items (as either
charm config options, or as variables in your playbook):

Required:
 * app_label - A label to identify your app - a domain will be fine.
 * code_archive - the relative name of your application code archive,
   eg. "r25/my-app.bzip2", or "beta-test/my-app.bzip2".
 * wsgi_application - the location of your wsgi application relative to
   your code. This is passed to the wsgi provider. For example:
   "myproject.wsgi:application".

Optional:
 * code_asset_uri - an optional uri from which the code_archive will be
   sourced. Without this, it'll look for code_archive in the ${CHARM}/files
   directory.
 * current_symlink - an optional label that can be used for rolling upgrades.
   By default this always points to the last installed code_archive. But you
   can explicitly request a previously installed version of your code to be
   used instead.
 * listen_port - the port on which the wsgi provider should serve your app.
 * env_extra - extra environment variables to pass to the wsgi-file provider.
